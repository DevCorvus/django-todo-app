This is a simple to-do app built in Django, TailwindCSS and Postgres (nothing special at all).

## Context

> NOTE: This is a public update of the project and I want to be brief as I have already written more details about this project in the demo, more information below.

This is my first project developed and published in Django and my first overall with Python. The purpose of the project was simply to test the framework so a great display of technical skill is not to be expected. In any case, the experience of said development was quite satisfactory and largely fulfilled the learning objective for me.

The code just works but beyond that, better to say nothing, _ahem_. Also, it hasn't received any modifications for this public "Update", I've just added this README, a license and not much else.

You can check, if you are interested, the About page of the demo I wrote back then, where you will find more details: https://djangotodoapp-devcorvus.herokuapp.com/about

Thanks for reading! ❤️
